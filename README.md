##  About the Test Files

Each major component of the pipeline has a corresponding test script. If something doesn't work, you can debug or verify functionality by running the appropriate test file individually:

- `test_preprocessing.py`: Verifies risk text preprocessing
- `test_parser.py`: Checks extraction of the ‚ÄúRisk Factors‚Äù section
- `test_sentiment.py`: Tests sentiment classification
- `test_topics.py`: Validates topic extraction (TF-IDF + KMeans)
- `testing_final.py`: End-to-end test combining all modules

You can run any test file using:
```bash
python test_<module>.py
```

Example:
```bash
python test_sentiment.py
```
